# Rent Price Classification Model

This project is a simple machine learning model that predicts if a house rent price is **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** based on different factors.

## 📌 What This Project Does

- Uses rent data to train a model.
- Sorts rent prices into three groups: **Low, Medium, High**.
- Uses basic machine learning techniques to make predictions.
- Shows graphs to help understand the data.

## 🚀 How to Use It

### 1️⃣ What You Need

Make sure you have these installed:

- Python (3.7 or newer)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Some Python libraries (install them with this command):

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 2️⃣ Get the Data

Download the **House Rent Dataset** from [source link] or use your own rent data with details like location, size, and amenities.

### 3️⃣ Run the Notebook

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `RentClassificationModel.ipynb` and run the steps one by one.

## 📊 What’s Inside

- **Data Cleaning**: Fixes missing values and formats data.
- **Graphs & Charts**: Helps understand how rent prices change.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Learns patterns to predict rent prices.
- **Checking Accuracy**: Tests the model to see how well it works.
